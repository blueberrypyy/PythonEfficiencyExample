Question 1: Anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters 
of another. For example: Silent is an Anagram of Listen. How can we determine 
if a given word is an Anagram? 
- MemoryEfficientAnogram.py

Question 2: Write or Explain something that compares the top 3 most resource 
intensive processes on a Linux machine and compare it to the top 3 most resource 
intensive processes on a Windows or iOS machine. 
- ResourceUsage.py

Assume a large dataset exists that contains a large set of device identifiers 
in the form of MAC addresses (over 10,000+). The RESTful API can take around 
5 seconds to complete a single status check, so checking device status is a 
relatively long running task. Also assume that the device identifiers (MAC addresses) 
come from a data source / stream that separates each MAC address by a newline.
Explain or write up how you would design a Python application that processes MAC 
addresses with the goal of: minimizing runtime, minimizing resource usage, and 
generalizing methods and processes. 
- MACprocessor.py
